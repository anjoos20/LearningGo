In addition to the main package, we can have other packages that all belong to our application
The usecase is that eg: An application that handles booking for 10 different conferences.
And the booking logic for each conferences is almost completely different.
In this case, we could create own packages for each of the conferences and put the booking logic there
And plus they share some common logic like validating user inputs and that could also be a 
separate package, that all other packages may share.
Basically these multiple packages help you oraganise your code and group the logic in a way that makes 
sense for your application
The different packages need to be in separate folders
