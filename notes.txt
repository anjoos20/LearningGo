How to modularize the application - can the application consist of multiple files?

Go programs are organised into packages
A package is a collection of Go files which can be 1 file or several files
We have a package called main and a go file for that - main.go.
But if our go file gets larger we can split them into multiple files
eg: in this tutorial - helper.go contain helper functions of the main application
